# Asynchronous Constructs in ES 2017 - What's the hype?

This is a repository for the deck of the abovementioned topic title that was presented in talk.js - August 2017.

## About the topic
The topic disucss about the new asynchronous constructs for ES 2017 using async/await keywords. It does not fully cover the whole of asynchronous programming in Javascript.
This repo, however, can be used to input knowledge about asynchronous programming in Javascript, as listed in the next section.

## Suggested topics to explore (including async/await constructs).

1. Basics of asynchronous behaviours in Javascript
	1. AJAX
	2. Event Loops

2. Review of asynchronous javascript constructs over the years.
	1. Event handler
	2. Callbacks
	3. Promises
	4. Generators
	5. async/await

3. Error Handling in asynchronous Javascript	
	
4. Essential Functions in asynchronous Javascript
	1. Delay of promises (an equvalent of Thread sleep for a certain duration.)
	2. Cancellation of Promises in asynchronous Javascript
	3. Waiting for all promises or one promise to complete.
	
5. Asynchronous programming with Webworkers, JS threads (in node js) and Parallelism.

6. Reactive programming in Javascript
	1. Asynchronous enumerable
	2. RxJS

7. Implementing actors programming in Javascript

8. Dataflow programming in Javascript

9. Testing asynchronous javascript code.
